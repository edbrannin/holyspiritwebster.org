        <span class="txt-black-sm">Beginning with this month of October, the Holy 
        Hour on the second Friday of each month will be dedicated to our sister 
        parish in the Ivory Coast. I would like to invite as many parishioners 
        who can do so, to join the group of faithful people who spend an hour 
        before the Blessed Sacrament and offer their prayer for the Christian 
        Community of Our Lady of Africa in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.<br>
        I take this opportunity to remind anyone who wishes to offer a story, 
        a good wish, a prayer, or a photo for the Parish Scrapbook being prepared 
        by Carolyn King as a gift to send to our sister parish. There is a box 
        in the church foyer where any item listed above can be deposited for the 
        scrapbook. It would be nice if many parishioners would participate in 
        this project. Thank you.<br>

        <span class="txt-black-sm">PROJECT No. 1 came to its full completion when 
        the Holy Spirit BANNER was placed in the Church of Our Lady of Africa 
        on Sunday October 19, 2008. Hopefully we will receive some photos in the 
        near future. ACTIVITY No. 1 started on the second Friday of this month 
        of October, when those present at the regularly scheduled Holy Hour prayed 
        for the parishioners of Our Lady of Africa. PROJECT No.2 - the making 
        of a Holy Spirit Church SCRAPBOOK to send to our sister parish - is underway. 
        You can continue to contribute photos old and new, brief saying, or other 
        memorabilia. Drop them in the box set for this project in our church foyer. 
        PROJECT No.3 begins this Sunday. Barb Trottier (872-5282) will place a 
        box in the church foyer to collect Christmas ornaments to be sent to our 
        sister parish. The package will be shipped at the beginning of December. 
        Please drop off what you wish to donate ASAP. Many Thanks to everyone.<br>

        <span class="txt-black-sm">To join Project #3, use your own talents by 
        making a non-breakable Christmas ornament for Our Lady of Africa&#146;s 
        parish tree or purchase one from our crafty crew to fill the box in our 
        church gathering area. Please call Marianne Schonning at 787-0281 for 
        more details.</span></p>

        <span class="txt-black-sm">We have now completed our Christmas Decorations 
        Project. The collected items will be shipped to our sister parish during 
        this coming week. This month we begin our second spiritual activity: PRAYING 
        ONE HOUR BEFORE THE BLESSED SACRAMENT for members of Our Lady of Africa 
        Parish Community. You will find special cards on the table at the entrance 
        of the church, which you can take a few moments to fill after you have 
        spent an hour before the Blessed Sacrament at your convenience. You will 
        also find the names of members of Our Lady of Africa to select before 
        you begin the adoration. These cards will then be collected at the end 
        of each month and sent to the pastor of Our Lady of Africa who will distribute 
        them to the individuals for whom you prayed. Thank you for participating 
        in this beautiful activity.</span></p>

        <span class="txt-black-sm">This month of January we begin our 4th Sister 
        Parish Project: It's PEN PAL time. If you are interested, please contact 
        me at 872-5039 or Vinnie Amuso. Also, we begin this month something special 
        for our own parish that will ultimately benefit not only ourselves but 
        our country as well (and later also our sister parish). <br>
        <br>
        We will hold on the Wednesday after the first Sunday of each month a special 
        holy hour before our Lord in the church from 7-8 PM based on the prayerful 
        reading of a brief selection from the Holy Scriptures followed by meditation. 
        It's a very old Christian practice called Lectio Divina. Flyers are available 
        at the church entrance for anyone who wishes to know more. We invite you 
        to join us and enjoy God's presence.</span><span class="footer"><br>

        1. Join other members of our parish in prayer during the Holy Hour (8-9PM) 
        on the second Friday of each month.<br>
        2. Offer a Holy Hour at your own time for a person in need either from 
        our parish or from Our Lady of Africa, and fill out the prayer card provided. 
        The first group of prayer cards have already been sent to our Sister Parish.<br>

        and to become involved, according to each individual's choice, in some 
        of the projects and activities that take place during the year. Many blessings 
        are showered on all members of the two churches through a strengthened
