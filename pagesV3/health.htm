        <span class="bkg-grey">Healthy Eating</span><span class="stdTextBlack"><br>
        </span><span class="txt-black-sm">Research has shown that following a 
        healthy eating plan can both reduce the risk of developing high blood 
        pressure and lower an already elevated blood pressure.<br>
        <br>
        A healthy eating plan is one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and lowfat 
        dairy foods and is low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol. This 
        plan would also include whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts and has 
        reduced amounts of fats, red meat, sweets and sugared beverages.<br>
        Healthy eating would include a low sodium diet. Most Americans consume 
        more salt than they need. The current recommendation is to consume less 
        than 2.4 grams (2,400 milligrams) of sodium a day. That equals 6 grams 
        (about 1 teaspoon) of table salt a day. A lower sodium diet can keep blood 
        pressure from rising and help blood pressure medicines work bette</span><span class="stdTextBlack">r..<br>

        <span class="bkg-grey">Limit Alcohol Intake: </span><span class="stdTextBlack"><br>
        </span><span class="txt-black-sm">Drinking too much alcohol can raise 
        blood pressure. It also can harm the liver, brain, and heart. Alcoholic 
        drinks also contain calories, which matter if you are trying to lose weight. 
        If you drink alcoholic beverages, have only a moderate amount - one drink 
        a day for women and two drinks a day for men. What counts as a drink? 
        A drink is, 12 oz. of beer, or 5 oz. of wine, or 1&frac12; oz. of 80-proof 
        whiskey</span><span class="stdTextBlack"><br>
        </span><br>
        <span class="bkg-grey">Quit Smoking: </span><span class="txt-black-sm"><br>
        Smoking injures blood vessel walls and speeds up the process of hardening 
        of the arteries. This applies even to filtered cigarettes. So even though 
        it does not cause high blood pressure, smoking is bad for anyone, especially 
        those with high blood pressure. If you smoke, quit. If you don&#146;t 
        smoke, don&#146;t start. Once you quit, your risk of having a heart attack 
        is reduced after the first year. So you have a lot to gain by quitting.<br>
        <br>
        The Health Ministry is pleased to have brought you this series of information 
        on high blood pressure. We invite and encourage you to stop in and have 
        your blood pressure checked when screenings are offered at your parish. 
        You can also check the monthly calendar to see which weekend each of the 
        parishes offers blood pressure screenings. </span></p>

        <span class="txt-black-sm-bold">Stay Hydrated All Day Long</span><br>
        <span class="txt-black-sm">You probably know the health benefits of drinking 
        plenty of water, but actually not drinking enough of it can lead to dehydration 
        and fatigue. If you need to increase the amount of water you drink: Take 
        water breaks instead of coffee breaks; skip high calorie or sweetened 
        beverages which promote cavities and weight gain Keep a bottle of water 
        with you always Drink water, before, during and after physical activity 
        Add a splash of fruit juice if you don&#146;t like the taste of water 
        Don&#146;t wait until you are thirsty to drink water; stay hydrated all 
        day long!</span></p>
      <p><span class="bkg-grey">Get Active, Stay Active</span><br>
        <span class="txt-black-sm">Along with a well-balanced diet, exercise is 
        important for losing weight and maintaining overall health. With planning, 
        you can easily fit 30-60 minutes of aerobic activity into your routine 
        most days of the week. Aerobic activity includes walking, bike riding, 
        dancing, and skating. Decide which activities you enjoy and look at your 
        schedule to see where it can fit in. **If you&#146;re starting from no 
        or little physical activity, check with your physician first but start 
        with 5-10 minute sessions daily. Once you achieve that level, boost it 
        every week by 10 minute increments until you&#146;re up to 30-60 minutes 
        per day. For maximum cardiovascular health, do the activity all at one 
        time instead of breaking it up throughout the day.</span></p>

        <span class="bkg-grey">Advance Care Planning: What is it?</span><span class="txt-black-sm"><br>
        Advance Care Planning is a process of planning for future medical care 
        in case you are unable to make your own decisions. It is a continual process 
        and not merely a document or isolated event and will assist you in preparing 
        for a sudden unexpected illness from which you expect to recover, as well 
        as the dying process and ultimately death.<br>
        Advance Care Planning is a gift to you and your family and is important 
        in assuring that your wishes are honored if you are unable to speak for 
        yourself. Directives apply only when the need arises and you are unable 
        to speak for yourself.<br>
        Information on Advance Care Planning and Health Care Proxy forms, including 
        a Guide for Catholics, will be available once a month, at your Blood Pressure 
        Screening site beginning the weekend of February 6/7. Please check the 
        bulletin for more information on this topic.</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="txt-black-sm" ><span class="bkg-grey">The Advance 
        Care Planning Process </span> <br>
        involves the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Becoming educated about the topic.</li>
        <li>Exploring, clarifying, and documenting your values, beliefs and goals.</li>
        <li>Choosing a Spokesperson and an Alternate to work with doctors on your 
          behalf in the event you are unable to speak for yourself.</li>
        <li>Reviewing your wishes with your Spokesperson, Alternate and those 
          important to you.</li>
        <li>Completing the NYS Health Care Proxy and Living Will forms that identify 
          your Spokesperson and Alternate and specify your wishes.</li>
        <li>Reviewing and updating these forms periodically and after major life-altering 
          events.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="txt-black-sm">Conducting ongoing discussions about updates

        <span class="txt-black-sm">As you know, there's been a lot in the news 
        media of late about the flu. As has always been the case if you or members 
        of your family are coughing, sneezing or otherwise ill, it is a good idea 
        to stay home from Mass to recuperate and so as not to infect others. Likewise, 
        you should not drink from the cup during Holy Communion if you are sick; 
        remember that we receive the whole Christ, &quot;body, blood, soul and 
        divinity&quot; when we receive of the Eucharist in either form. During 
        the Sign of Peace, you can offer a smile and little bow rather than a 
        handshake if you feel under the weather or feel especially vulnerable, 
        just as you can refrain from holding hands during the Our Father from 
        similar concerns. For our part, we'll be monitoring the situation in our 
        area carefully through health advisories, and we'll adjust our practices 
        as a faith community if necessary</span></p>
