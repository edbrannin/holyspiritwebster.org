        forming a partnership that will strengthen our commitment to prayer, worship,

        As a first initiative, the Webster-Penfield parishes will join the Cathedral

        is hoped that it will include shared liturgies, an open invitation to 
        events in each other&#145;s parishes, social events, and a general coming-together&#145; 
        to help us understand each other&#145;s needs as city and suburban communities
